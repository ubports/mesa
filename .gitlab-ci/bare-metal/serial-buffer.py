# Tiny script to read bytes from serial, and write the output to stdout, with a
# buffer in between so we don't lose serial output from its buffer.
#
# We don't use 'cu' because it requires stdin to be hooked up and I never
# managed to make that work without getting blocked somewhere.  We don't use
# 'conserver' because it's non-free.
